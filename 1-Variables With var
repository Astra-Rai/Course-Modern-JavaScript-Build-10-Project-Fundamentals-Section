//3 Ways to create variable in Javascript var, let and const

/*
Opening Exercise
let name = prompt('What is your name?');
document.getElementById('welcome').innerHTML = 'Welcome ' + name + ','  + ' You are the real MVP';
*/


//name for variable and contain letters, numbers or underscores
//variables cannot start with numbers 
//variablecan start with underscore

//you can use double or single quotes to wrap value of variable, but it must be consisent

var learning = "JavaScript";//double quotes at each end, you cannot have a single quote on one end and then double quote on the other. Syntax error: vaild or unexpected token

//variables with two or more words
//note use of camel case
var firstName = 'John Pablo';//use camel case
//var first_Name or pascal case FirstName



var age = 20; //number does need quotes
var job = true//data type boolean
var names = ['Astra', 'Rai'];

//you can start a variable without any value
var learn;
learn ='coding';
console.log(learn); // --> undefined

var learningToday = 'JavaScript',
    name = 'Juan';
//note above, it's assumed that the keyword to declare the varible is var, same as key word on line 35, note the comma after the string 'JavaScript and not a semicolon'

//a way to create multiple variables

var thisIsOne, thisIsTwo;
thisIsOne = 1;
thisIsTwo = 2;

//console.log(thisIsOne); // --> 1
//console.log(thisIsTwo); // --> 2

var today = 'Saturday';
var today = 'Monday';

console.log(today);// --> Monday will print, not Saturday, var value can be overridden,this is not considered good practice.
